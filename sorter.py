# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence. Example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180 The output of the program should be: 18,22,24
